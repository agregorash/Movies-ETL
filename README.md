# Movie Analysis- Extract Transform Load

## Project Overview

Amazing Prime, a video streaming company is sponsoring a hackathon, where participants are tasked with predicting which low budget movies being released will become the most popular.  In order to build the predictive models we must first clean it into a usable dataset through ETL.  

## Resources
- Data Sources: [ratings.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/Movies-ETL/blob/main/Resources/.gitignore), [movies_metadata.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/Movies-ETL/blob/main/Resources/movies_metadata.csv), [wikipedia-movies.json](https://github.com/agregorash/Movies-ETL/blob/main/Resources/wikipedia-movies.json)
               
 - Software: Python 3.8.3, Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda 3, pgAdmin 4

## Results
The result of this project is a single function that can be called to clean and transform any movie data from the given data sources and load it into SQL where further analyses can be performed.
